# GAME 395 CRN: 23699 Unity Project Folder

This is where you could have multiple Unity projects under this folder.

## Notes

I will be adding project templates here from Unity that align with your project idea and/or agreement. This is also where you will have your final unity project. It's very important to get this setup early and use it throughout the class so we can show progress by utilizing GitHub and the project board in alignment with this project.

- [x] Added Game to GitHub
