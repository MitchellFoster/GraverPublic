# GRAVER

## Project Abstract

My project, GRAVER, is a 2D, Singleplayer, Platform, Side-scrolling, Adventure Game game similar to Hollow Knight. The overall goal was to create one working 2D level with different minor enemies and a final boss at the end. The player will be able to traverse through the world like a normal platformer with extra abilities to make it similar to a puzzle. Combat and movement was the main focus. I added some lighting with the VFX and different camera movement with Cinemachine. I used statemachines for the animation and movement. Making the game aesthetically was also a goal of mine. A task that was difficult was the enemy AI since I never learned it before. I used GitHub as a home for this game and developing tasks through GitHub Projects. I used many assets since I did not have a lot of time, but made some of my own with the player and some enemies.

## Project Build Requirements

  * How to play?
    * Keyboard 
    * W, A, S, D to move ("W" does not really have a function though)
    * Space to jump
    * Left mouse button to attack
    * Shift or 'S' to ghost mode (but that is when you collect the power-up)
  * Build Environment Information
    * Windows, Intel 64-bit, and default compression (default settings)
      * No issues with the building

## Unity Project Version and Unity Packages

Unity 2021.3.9f1, and I used Cinemachine and new Input System for Unity. Assets I used are Crystal World Platformer, Free Pixel Art Forest, Pixel Art Platformer - Village Props, and Rocky World Platformer for the background, props, and some enemies.

## Project Reflection

 * Unity is an amazing tool for game development, especially for beginners and intermediates. It has a user-friendly interface and a wide range of features that make it easy to create professional-quality games. While it is true that some big gaming businesses prefer to use Unreal Engine over Unity, that does not diminish the value of Unity as a tool. In fact, many successful games have been created using Unity, and it continues to be a popular choice among game developers.

 * I really enjoyed this class, and I believe it has helped me become a better game designer. The challenge of creating a game level was daunting at first, but with the help of the class and my own determination, I was able to create a level that I am proud of. The class also introduced me to new features of Unity, such as the VFX Graph and 3D tools, which I may not have explored on my own.

 * One of the most valuable things I learned in this class from the professional visits was the importance of experience in game design. Simply creating and sharing your work is often the best way to improve and gain recognition in the industry. I also appreciated the opportunity to learn about GitHub and how it can be used to manage game development projects.

 * Overall, I think this class was a great experience, and I am grateful for the knowledge and skills I have gained. My only suggestions for improvement would be to have more in-class workdays where students can get help with their projects and to incorporate more opportunities for students to work on their own projects during class time. Additionally, providing a cheat sheet or vocabulary list with terms and concepts used in the class may be helpful for students who are not programmers. 

 * I am proud of what I have accomplished in this class, and I am excited to continue learning and improving as a game designer. Thank you for the opportunity to learn and grow!

## Project Next Steps

  * If I continued, I would make it more of an open-world game rather than level style. I really would want to make it more challenging with the enemies with high-risk, high reward. If the player died, then they would feel like they lost a lot, but not too much to make them stop playing. More abilities would be a bigger focus with puzzles connected to those abilities as well.
