# Game 395 Project Proposal CRN# 23699

Below in this markdown file you will find a lot of information on what you have to do. This entire document is a template. Please make a copy of it, name it with your first character of your first name + last name + "_Proposal", for example mine would be 'JShull_Proposal.md' and place that document in this folder. Then remove all of the information from the document but leave the markdown headers.

## Title

>Give me a title that aligns to what we talked about in our one-on-one, it could be the name of your game, it could be the name of your software application, it could just be a phrase representing what you're doing, this title should give me some insight and/or be used as a hook
>
## Project Abstract

>This has to stay under 1000 characters and needs to outline what you're going to be working on towards the class - use the PulseCheck.md and your own GDD or SDD to give you some ideas on the material you should mention here. You won't be able to mention all of it so summarize your major objectives and highlight your main learning goals: (think about what you already put in the student questionnaire) each sentence should align to a learning goal, and/or some core unity system you're going to be either implementing, using, modding, etc. If you have a sentence that doesn't directly connect to something that's part of your plan, part of your GDD/SDD, part of our PulseCheck and/or not mentioned anywhere else yet really think hard on the importance of that information and if it's needed or not. Anytime you are proposing or pitching a game or software to anyone you have to be very methodical in why you're highlighting and/or mentioning various pieces of information, if you're just writing a bunch of nonsense people will directly see through that. If you're going into too many details on some crazy technical implementation, save that for later as the person reading the abstract and/or initial proposal probably isn't a full blown technical lead. If you're about to pitch the worlds greatest RPG you better explain somewhere why this will be the worlds greatest RPG and importantly you only have a few sentences to get that out and it needs to connect to the plan behind the pitch/proposal. Best hint I can give you: work through the plan first, get your materials organized, then write this **LAST!** Here are some examples sentences to help. Do **not** use them word for word.
>
>**Example sentences**
>> "This project proposal takes advantage of the Unity 3D Game Kit template to showcase my [game] that will take advantage of the [core unity system] in which the player will be able [game feature/mechanic]."
>>
>> "I plan to learn the basics of visual scripting within Unity3D to help modify and extend the [core unity system] by using the [program design pattern]."
>>
>> "My major objective is to implement a [type of game] while learning the general unity editor and really getting a good understanding of [some unity system] to deliver a working, compiled, playable version of the game by the end of the semester."
>>
>> "This project proposal is for me to learn the ways of working within a system like Unity3D. I intend to better understand how you can use Unity and [some project management approach] to build better organizational structured packages for my team."
>
>**Example Abstracts**: below I am giving you a little insight into what the intent of the example abstract is, this isn't needed when you put your document together, it's there to help provide additional background towards why the abstract is written the way it is.
>
>>Main Proposal Intent: To pitch why learning Unity3D by learning a template/style of game is one of the best approaches.
>>
>>**Abstract**:"Unity3d is a powerful game engine that allows for the creation of complex 3D games. However, it can be challenging for students to learn all of the features and systems in Unity3d in a short amount of time. This is where a 2D platformer game can be helpful. By focusing on a specific genre of game, students can learn the key systems in Unity3d that are necessary for creating a fun and playable game. In addition, by working on a 2D platformer game, students will be able to learn how to use Unity3dâ€™s physics system to create believable and realistic gameplay.
>
>>Main Proposal Intent: To pitch why my 2D platformer game will help me work towards my certification and help me towards interviews and getting a job in industry.
>>
>>**Abstract**: "My extreme 2D Platformer game using Unity3D is going to help me work towards completing a unity3d certificate and prepare me to work for a studio because it will allow me to practice and hone my skills in Unity3D by learning the Input System and the Physics system. In addition, by developing the project plan that goes with such a game, I will gain valuable experience in the entire game development process. This will be an invaluable asset when applying for jobs at studios as I can then use this material to help build up my portfolio. By the end of the semester I plan to deliver a version 1 of the 2D Platformer and showcase my finished GitHub page about the game to add to my portfolio."
>>
>>Main Proposal Intent: To pitch why learning Unity, GitHub, and focusing in on content workflows will help me be a better team member for my current job.
>>
>>**Abstract**: "As a team member, learning Unity3d with version control software like GitHub will help you be a better collaborator by allowing me to manage and merge changes with other team members more effectively. I will be focusing in on building unity addressable assets and using the package manager system to manage versions of asset packs. This workflow will help me keep track of my own work and progress on projects more efficiently. In addition, I will be able to learn from other members of my team and collaborate more efficiently.

## Unity Project Version and Unity Packages

>This will be a difficult decision but it's one we all make when using Unity. What version do you start with and why? The why should be driven by the capabilities of the version and how it aligns towards your project. In most cases there's a brand new *hot* feature Unity has just added, in order to use it = you have to be in the most recent version. That sometimes is the deciding factor! If that's the decision you go with, list it out here to support it. This section is going to be difficult for you all to work through because it requires that you have to dive into the Unity documentation to evaluate your choices. I suggest you start with the version of the Unity template project you're going to be utilizing. Most of you will be using either the [3D Game Kit](https://learn.unity.com/project/3d-game-kit) or the [2D Game Kit](https://learn.unity.com/project/2d-game-kit) the Learn Pathways both use 2020.3. You will have to make the decision if you want to stay in that version of Unity or attempt at upgrading towards a newer version of Unity. You need to go through these template projects and identify the Unity Package Manager packages (and their versions) that are being used. You don't need to list them all here but justify your decision with package version details that align to your objectives of this class - for example - if one of your main objectives is to implement a player mechanic through the Unity Input System you might decided to upgrade the templates input system because it doesn't give you the capability that you need. That's the sort of information that needs to be explained here. Keep it to a few sentences and keep it towards the major objectives.

## Project Plan Milestones

>Your project plan will be submitted on the GitHub Project that has already been assigned to you. We will be working on this together in class on September 21st. This table below summarizes your main contributes towards that project. In this section of the document I need the breakdown structure of your high level milestones in a Markdown table.

## Unity Learn Planning Milestones

>Your project plan will include Unity Learn information tasks. This table below is just an outline of the Unity Learn Pathway you've gone with. Before committing to one of the Unity Learn Pathways: go through the pathway and breakdown the major objectives of the pathway, identify the time that Unity tells you it will take, and then you breakdown the weeks you're planning on working on those objectives, please provide them in the formatted table below. Consider that on average a 3-credit class generally requires between 2-4 hours of additional effort, factor in that as a number to set yourself up for by the week: aka don't say your going to do 20 hours of unity learning in one week - keep it under 4.

|Unity Learn Mission/Objective|Description|Estimated Time|Expected Date of Completion|
|--|--|--|--|
|VFX Systems|Learning about visual VFX systems|3 hours|10-10-2022|
|Cameras|Configure a Camera for Unity in 2D and 3D|3 hours|10-17-2022|
|Programming-Sound and Effects 1 of 2|Add music and effects to Unity|3 hours|10-24-2022|
|Programming-Sound and Effects 2 of 2|Add music and effects to Unity|4 hours|10-31-2022|
