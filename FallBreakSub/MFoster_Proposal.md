## GRAVER

> 2D, Singleplayer, Platform, Side-scrolling, Adventure Game

## Project Abstract

>   My project, GRAVER, will be a 2D action-adventure game similar to Hollow Knight and Castle Crashers. This project will take advantage of the Unity 2D Game Kit assets to improve upon what has already been created for a foundation. My overall goal is to create one working 2D level with different minor enemies and a final boss at the end. The player will be able to traverse through the world like a normal platformer with extra abilities to make it similar to a puzzle. Combat and movement will be the main focus, and with Unity’s tools and tutorials on YouTube, I will be able to accomplish these tasks. Through the use of the Unity Creative Core, I will also be able to learn the basics of lighting, cameras, VFX, and animation. I will do this by using Unity’s VFX, animation, and state machines to give feedback to the player when attacking and running. Making the game aesthetically pleasing using Unity’s tools is another major goal of mine. One difficult part of creating this project will be the enemy AI needed to be a challenge to the player, and I will tackle this task with YouTube since there are many tutorials available. I will be using GitHub as a home for this game and developing tasks through GitHub Projects. I will be creating a lot of my own assets because I do not want to copy others.

>   The story behind this game is that the player is a nightly grave watcher that is doing his normal task of grave watching. The player then trips into an open grave and falls into a void that seems rather spooky. The grave watcher is not himself anymore, but that is the least of his worries since there are other creatures with him in the dark forest-like area. The goal of the game is to escape the forest by fending off the enemies that will attack the player on sight. By defeating the enemies the player will become more powerful with loot and experience. At the end of the level, the player will defeat the reaper and the game will end. The combat will be based off of Terraria's point and click. Where the cursor is, the player will attack in that direction or area. 

>   My expectations for this project are to learn about Unity and its capabilities in making 2D games (some 3D with the Creative Core) in a solo environment. This game creation will also aid me in learning GitHub and focusing on the workflow structure needed within the gaming industry. Since I will be working alone, I will develop skills in a lot of areas for game development. Overall, I want to learn through Unity’s tools and self-research to develop my own game design skills in this 2D project. 

## Unity Project Version and Unity Packages

>   The Unity version I will be using is Unity 2021.3.9f1, since it has LTS and is close to the project version I was currently using. It is also used in class, and it will not change files between my two work stations. I will use LTS as something to fall back on just in case I want to continue the progress of the game after class. I will use are the 2D game kit for its mechanics code, controllers, and for its template game to reference. I may not add the 2D template to my game, but copy code from another Unity application/folder that will be open as I work. Most of my art will come from the Pixel Art Platformer - Village Props package since all I really need to make is enemies. I will use a package called Free Pixel Art Forest for its forest art that will be added as parallax background. I will also use the built in Cinemachine for better camera movement. I may add more packages if time permits.
