# PULSE Checks

![SlothLoot](../Images/SlothLoot-01.png)

**P**rogressing **U**pward **L**earning & **S**elf-**E**valuating. This system is based around two progress check-in with ideally a 3rd check-in during the middle of the semester. It's based around a learning cycle that deals with concrete experiences, reflective observation, abstract hypothesis, and active testing <sup>1</sup>.

## PULSE Progress Cycle

- [X] Beginning of Semester (2-3 weeks)
- [X] Middle of Semester (7-9 weeks)
- [X] End of Semester (14-16 weeks)

## Project Idea

In our first one-on-one meeting you will spend a couple minutes explaining your project idea, we will use these few minutes to make adjustments and scope it correctly while aligning it to a Unity certificate trajectory through using Unity Learn.

>**PROJECT DETAILS**
> "The project I want to work on is called **Graver**, which is a 2D pixel-art combat-based loot game. In the game story, you are a grave watcher doing your job at night. You trip on a rock and fall into an open grave that transports you into a new world. You must fight deadly, dead(?) creatures to get out of that unknown realm. The game will play and look similar to other 2D games, such as Castle Crashers, Terraria, and Hollow Knight. I want combat and movement to be the main focus on how players progress further into the level. I will develop this game for PC and possibly add controller support later on. Over the summer, I worked on this game a little bit. I added the player, a bit of the world objects, and preset graphics. At the moment, it is stuck on my PC at home, but I will be able to get it on GitHub when I go back home next weekend for my brother's wedding. My goal is to have a title screen, the first level with more polished events and mechanics, and a boss to top it off.
> Excellent idea: depending upon what you started with I would suggest looking into the Unity [2D Game Kit](https://learn.unity.com/project/2d-game-kit) to see what you can take advantage of.

### Unity Learn Pathway and Unity Certification

Unity has great resources for their Unity Learn platform. A major portion of this class is utilizing those services, please identify which Unity Learn Pathway you want to explore and then how that pathway could help lead towards a potential certification opportunity later after this class.

>**Creative Core Pathway**
>
> Setup an account with Unity, go to the Unity Learn environment and begin participating in the [Creative Core Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/creative-core). This pathway you will work on throughout the weeks and over the course of the class you should come close to completion of it. At the end of the class you will be required to show that your Unity Learn pathway has generated significant progress.
>
>**Associate Pathway**
>
>Interested in [Certified Associate Game Developer](https://unity.com/products/unity-certifications/associate-game-developer) unity certification, but will not do it during this class.
